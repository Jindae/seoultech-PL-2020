# 2020 Fall Term Programming Language Theory

This is 2020 Fall Term Programming Language Theory Course Repository.

It's one of the main communication channels for the course.
In this repository, you can find lecture slides and material for practice sessions, and you can also post questions.
I'll check questions as often as possible, but if my reply is late, please send an email to jindae.kim@seoultech.ac.kr.


### For Notification

On the top-right corner of the page, you can find an eye icon with your notification status.
Set the state to `Releases Only` or `Watching`, so that you can get a notification via your email when there is something new.
If you think notifications are too often, change it to `Not Watching`, still you can get notified if you're involved.


### How to Post a Question

You can post your questions in Issues menu. Click Issues > New Issue to register your question as an issue.
For details, check the [first issue](https://github.com/Jindae/seoultech-PL-2020/issues/1) as an example.

There are two things you need to remember.

1. Don't forget to put Question label.
2. When you use code in a post, mark it with \` or \`\`\`.

:zipper_mouth_face: Caution!! This is a public repository. Never post your valuable private information on any posts.
